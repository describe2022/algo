## closeness centrality

In a connected graph, closeness centrality (or closeness) of a node is a measure of centrality in a network, calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all other nodes in the graph. Thus, the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes.

## betweenness centrality

In [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory), **betweenness centrality** is a measure of [centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality) in a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) based on [shortest paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem). For every pair of vertices in a connected graph, there exists at least one shortest path between the vertices such that either the number of edges that the path passes through (for unweighted graphs) or the sum of the weights of the edges (for weighted graphs) is minimized. The betweenness centrality for each [vertex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)) is the number of these shortest paths that pass through the vertex.
