Our
algorithm uses the ratio of inter-community degree (number of
edges in a community) and intra-community degree (number
of edges emanating from a community) of each community
in the social graph to differentiate Sybil communities from
honest communities. The intuition is that usually a community
has fewer inter-community connections than intra-community
connections. Also, generally nodes from an honest community
tend to have larger number of inter-community edges with
nodes in other honest communities compared to nodes in
Sybil communities.
